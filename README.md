# guessTheCorrectNumber
Guess the correct number is a new interesting game.
The rules are simple:
Your opponent is the computer and chooses a random number between 1 and 100. 
Your task is to guess this number. 
After each number you enter, your opponent will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected, until you guess the right one.
